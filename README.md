# PgLock

Uses [Postgres advisory locks](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/view-pg-locks.html) to enable you to syncronize actions across processes and machines.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/heroku/pg_lock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/heroku/pg_lock)

## Installation

This gem requires Ruby 2.1+

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pg_lock'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pg_lock

## Usage

Create a `PgLock.new` instance and call the `lock` method to ensure exclusive execution of a block of code.

```ruby
PgLock.new(name: "all_your_base").lock do
  # stuff
end
```

Now no matter how many times this code is executed across any number of machines, one block of code will be allowed to execute at a time.

## Session based locking

The postgres lock is unique across different database sessions, if the same session tries to aquire the same lock it will succeed. So while `PgLock` will guarantee unique execution across machines and processes, it will not block the same process (sharing the same connection session) from running. For example while you would think the middle block would not run in this example:

```ruby
key = "all_your_base"
PgLock.new(name: key).lock do
  puts "First block called"
  PgLock.new(name: key).lock do
    puts "Second block called because it's sharing the same session"
  end
end
```

The result will be:

```
First block called
Second block called because it's sharing the same session
```

If you need to syncronize code execution inside of the same process you should [use a mutex](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Mutex.html).

## Timeout

By default, locked blocks will timeout after 60 seconds of execution, the lock will be released and any code executing will be terminated by raising `Timeout::Error`. You can decrease or increase this value by passing in a `ttl` (time to live) argument:

```ruby
begin
  PgLock.new(name: "all_your_base", ttl: 30).lock do
    # stuff
  end
rescue Timeout::Error
  puts "Took longer than 30 seconds to execute"
end
```

To disable the timeout pass in a falsey value:

```ruby
PgLock.new(name: "all_your_base", ttl: false).lock do
  # stuff
end
```

## Retry Attempts

By default if a lock cannot be aquired, `PgLock` will try 3 times with a 1 second delay between tries. You can configure this behavior using `attempts` and `attempt_interval` arguments:

```ruby
PgLock.new(name: "all_your_base", attempts: 10, attempt_interval: 5).lock do
  # stuff
end
```

To run once use `attempts: 1`.

## Raise Error on Failed Lock

You can optionally raise an error if a block cannot be executed in the given number of attempts by using the `lock!` method:

```ruby
begin
  PgLock.new(name: "all_your_base").lock! do
    # stuff
  end
rescue PgLock::UnableToLockError
  # do stuff
end
```

## Manual Lock

The `create` method will return the `PgLock` instance if a lock object was created, or `false` if no lock was aquired. You should manually `delete` a successfully created lock object:

```ruby
begin
  lock = PgLock.new(name: "all_your_base")
  lock.create
  # do stuff
ensure
  lock.delete
end
```

You can check on the status of a lock with the `aquired?` method:

```ruby
begin
  lock = PgLock.new(name: "all_your_base")
  lock.create
  if lock.aquired?
    # do stuff
  end
ensure
  lock.delete
end
```

## Logging

By default there is no logging, if you want you can provide a logging block:

```ruby
PgLock.new(name: "all_your_base", log: ->(data) { puts data.inspect }).lock do
  # stuff
end
```

One argument will be passed to the block, a hash. You can optionally define a default log for all instances:

```ruby
PgLock::DEFAULT_LOG = ->(data) { puts data.inspect }
```

Note: When you enable logging exceptions raised when deleting a lock will be swallowed. To re-raise you can use the exception in `data[:exception]`.

## Database Connection

This library defaults to use Active Record. If you want to use another library, or spin up a dedicated connection you can use the `connection` argument:

```ruby
my_connection = MyCustomConnectionObject.new
PgLock.new(name: "all_your_base", connection: my_connection).lock do
  # stuff
end
```

The object needs to respond to the `exec` method where the first argument is a query string, and the second is an array of bind arguments. For example to use with [sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) you could do something like this:

```ruby
connection = Module do
  def self.exec(sql, bind)
    DB.fetch(sql, bind)
  end
end

PgLock.new(name: "all_your_base", connection: my_connection).lock do
  # stuff
end
```

Where `DB` is to be your database connection.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To run tests you'll need a database:

```
$ createdb pg_lock_test
```

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
